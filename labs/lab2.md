# Lab 2

This lab is focussed on topics related to empirical studies of
human-human dialogue. It includes three parts:

- Part 1: dialogue experiment
- Part 2: annotation task
- Part 3: write-up

## Part 1 Experiment

For Part 1 you should have signed up for a research study. If you haven't completed the research study yet or don't have an experiment session scheduled, please get in contact with course organisers.


## Part 2 Annotation task

In this part of the lab you need to annotate human-human dialogue data in accordance with annotation protocol.

**You are not allowed to work in groups in this part of the lab**.

You need to annotate one transcribed video from TOWIE (The Only Way Is Essex corpus). Download the spreadsheet depending on your **day of birth**:

- if your day of birth is **even**, annotate [TOWIE_2](./lab2/TOWIE_2.xlsx)
- if your day of birth is **odd**, annotate [TOWIE_4](./lab2/TOWIE_4.xlsx).

Click "download raw file" to download the spreadsheet. There is a link to the video in the annotation sheet, as well as a transcription key in another tab on the same file.

Read the [Face Effects Annotation Manual (Short version)](./lab2/Annotation_Manual_SHORT.pdf) thoroughly. Watch the video along with the transcribed text. Follow the annotation protocol to fill in of the spreadsheet.

## Part 3 Write-up

1. How do people do repair in text based chat?
  * Using examples from the [transcripts of the balloon task moral
    dilemma](./lab2/2025_BalloonTaskTranscripts.xlsx), discuss how the way people do visible repair
    (self-repair and clarification requests) is different in
    text-based chats compared to in face-to-face dialogue. Consider:
    - Do they use particular words/phrases or symbols to indicate they
      are doing a self-repair or clarification?
    - What types of repairables are there and do they all get repaired?
    - How are they placed in terms of turns?
    
2. What behavioural cues (linguistic and non-verbal) indicate a
   particular type of a face damaging effects? Choose one of the
   effects (SCon-, HCon-, SAut-, HAut-) and discuss how it can
   manifest itself in a dialogue. Refer to examples either from TOWIE
   or from other sources (e.g., Youtube videos).
   
3. How do AI chatbots deal with repair and face-damaging effects? Choose one of the LLM you have access to (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) and test it using the cues that you have indicated. 
   - What are the differences from human-human dialogue?
   - Which features that are currently not well accounted for would or
     would not be desirable in a dialogue system? Why?

## Submission

In your submission you should indicate that you have participated in the research study (Part 1). For Part 2, submit the annotate spreadsheet. For Part 3, submit a PDF file.
